## Calling scripts from the command line
Working on compute-clusters often required scheduling "jobs" from the command-line.
To run a Julia script in the file `my_script.jl`, run the following command:

```bash
$ julia my_script.jl arg1 arg2...
```

Inside your script, the additional command-line arguments `arg1` and `arg2` can be used through the global constant `ARGS`. 
If `my_script.jl` contains the code

```julia
# Content of my_script.jl
for a in ARGS
  println(a)
end
```
Calling it with arguments `foo`, `bar` from the command-line will print:
```bash
$ julia my_script.jl foo bar
foo
bar
```

### Command-line switches
Julia provides several
[command-line switches](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/command-line-interface/#command-line-interface).
For example, for parallel computing, `--threads` can be used to specify the number of CPU threads 
and `--procs` for the number of worker processes. 

The following command will run `my_script.jl` with 8 threads:

```bash
$ julia --threads 8 -- my_script.jl arg1 arg2
```

### External packages
Handling arguments in `ARGS` can be tedious.
[Comonicon.jl](https://github.com/comonicon/Comonicon.jl) is a package to build simple command-line interfaces for Julia programs by using a macro `@main`. Among other features, it supports
- positional arguments
- optional arguments with defaults
- boolean flags
- help pages generated from docstrings

Take a look at the [documentation](https://comonicon.org/stable/).

## Experiments with DrWatson.jl
[DrWatson.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/DrWatson.jl) 
describes itself as *"scientific project assistant software"*. It serves two purposes:
1. It sets up a project structure that is specialized for scientific experiments, similar to PkgTemplates.
1. It introduces several useful helper functions. Among these are boiler-plate functions for file loading and saving.

The following two sections are directly taken from the [DrWatson documentation](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DrWatson.jl/stable/workflow/), which I recommend reading

### File structure
To initialize a DrWatson project, run:
```julia-repl
julia> using DrWatson

julia> initialize_project("MyScientificProject"; authors="Adrian Hill", force=true)
```
The default setup will initialize a file structure that looks as follows:

```plaintext
│projectdir          <- Project's main folder. It is initialized as a Git
│                       repository with a reasonable .gitignore file.
│
├── _research        <- WIP scripts, code, notes, comments,
│   |                   to-dos and anything in an alpha state.
│   └── tmp          <- Temporary data folder.
│
├── data             <- **Immutable and add-only!**
│   ├── sims         <- Data resulting directly from simulations.
│   ├── exp_pro      <- Data from processing experiments.
│   └── exp_raw      <- Raw experimental data.
│
├── plots            <- Self-explanatory.
├── notebooks        <- Jupyter, Weave or any other mixed media notebooks.
│
├── papers           <- Scientific papers resulting from the project.
│
├── scripts          <- Various scripts, e.g. simulations, plotting, analysis,
│   │                   The scripts use the `src` folder for their base code.
│   └── intro.jl     <- Simple file that uses DrWatson and uses its greeting.
│
├── src              <- Source code for use in this project. Contains functions,
│                       structures and modules that are used throughout
│                       the project and in multiple scripts.
│
├── test             <- Folder containing tests for `src`.
│   └── runtests.jl  <- Main test file, also run via continuous integration.
│
├── README.md        <- Optional top-level README for anyone using this project.
├── .gitignore       <- by default ignores _research, data, plots, videos,
│                       notebooks and latex-compilation related files.
│
├── Manifest.toml    <- Contains full list of exact package versions used currently.
└── Project.toml     <- Main project file, allows activation and installation.
                        Includes DrWatson by default.
```
### Workflow
The DrWatson workflow is best summarized in the following picture from the 
[documentation](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DrWatson.jl/stable/workflow/):
